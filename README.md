Gamepads.js is a JavaScript module for tracking Gamepads and events pertaining to their usage. Gamepads.js also offers an optional gamepad icons extension containing button images, available [on GitHub](https://github.com/FThompson/Gamepads.js/tree/master/gamepad-icons) or [on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gamepad-icons) as `gamepad-icons`.

## Why use this library instead of the built-in Gamepad API?

The [existing Gamepad standard](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API/Using_the_Gamepad_API) lacks support for button/joystick events, and `gamepadconnected`/`gamepaddisconnected` events do not work consistently across browsers. This module seeks to offer a standard event-handling implementation that works across multiple browsers.

## Installation

### Via npm

```
npm install gamepads
```

```javascript
import Gamepads from 'gamepads';
```

### Via script tag

Include the script hosted on jsDelivr CDN or download it and include it on your page.

```html
<script src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/FThompson/gamepads.js@1.2.2/gamepads.min.js'></script>
```

## Usage

The `gamepads.js` script exposes the `Gamepads` object that takes care of event polling and tracking which gamepads are currently connected. You can add event handlers to this object to track when a gamepad is connected or disconnected.

```javascript
// Start polling
Gamepads.start();

// Add event listeners
Gamepads.addEventListener('connect', e => {
    console.log('Gamepad connected');
    console.log(e.gamepad);
});

Gamepads.addEventListener('disconnect', e => {
    console.log('Gamepad disconnected');
    console.log(e.gamepad);
});
```

These examples print the gamepad instances related to each connect or disconnect event. You can add event handlers to these gamepad objects to track gamepad events:
* `buttonpress` fires when a button is pressed and passes the button `index` to event handlers.
* `buttonrelease` fires when a button is released and passes the button `index` to event handlers.
* `buttonvaluechange` fires when a button value changes and passes the button `index` and `value` to event handlers. This value will typically be `0` or `1` except in the case of an axis button like a trigger, which can have a value between `0` and `1`.
* `axischange` fires when a gamepad axis changes and passes the axis `index` and `value` to event handlers.
* `joystickmove` fires when a joystick moves and passes the axes `indices` and `values` to event handlers each as two-item arrays. To use this event, you must pass a two-length array of axis indices to the third parameter of `addEventListener` corresponding to the horizontal and vertical axis indices. Joystick axis values go from `-1` (left/top) to `1` (right/bottom). This library applies a `0.10` deadzone by default, and this value is subtracted from the absolute minimum and maximum joystick axis values to smooth out values in the deadzone.

```javascript
Gamepads.addEventListener('connect', e => {
    console.log('Gamepad connected');
    console.log(e.gamepad);
    e.gamepad.addEventListener('buttonpress', e => console.log(e));
    e.gamepad.addEventListener('buttonrelease', e => console.log(e));
    e.gamepad.addEventListener('joystickmove', e => console.log(e), [0, 1]);
});
```

In this example, the `[0, 1]` parameter in the `joystickmove` event handler corresponds to the axis indices of the left joystick on the standard gamepad mapping.

You can query a gamepad to determine if it follows the standard gamepad mapping using `gamepad.mapping`. This value will either be `"standard"` or `""`.

The `gamepads.js` script includes an object containing the standard gamepad mapping, `StandardMapping`, with indices split up into `Button` and `Axis` objects. You can use these index values in gamepad event handlers to identify which buttons the user is interacting with.

```javascript
const xboxYIndex = StandardMapping.Button.BUTTON_TOP; // 3
const dpadUpIndex = StandardMapping.Button.D_PAD_UP; // 12
const leftStickIndices = StandardMapping.Axis.JOYSTICK_LEFT; // [0, 1]
```

Notice that the standard mapping object contains joystick index pairs you can use to specify which joystick you want to add an event handler to.

```javascript
e.gamepad.addEventListener('joystickmove', e => console.log(e), StandardMapping.Axis.JOYSTICK_LEFT);
```

## Live Example

You can view a live example [here](https://codepen.io/finnthompson/pen/VNBwEP) or browse [the /examples directory](https://github.com/FThompson/Gamepads.js/tree/master/examples). In the linked example, button images should appear when you press buttons and the two dots should mirror your gamepad joystick positions. The examples folder also contains a similar example created with React. Be sure to read the following Compatibility section if the code does not behave as expected. 

## Compatibility

The HTML5 Gamepad API backing `gamepads.js` is a relatively new API and various browser and gamepad configurations may perform differently, causing bugs such as non-responsive gamepads or non-standard mappings on standard gamepads. If a gamepad is not detected immediately, try pressing buttons or unplugging it and plugging it back in. If you are using a PS3 or PS4 gamepad, you may need to install [DS4Windows](http://ds4windows.com/), a program that emulates an Xbox 360 controller.

See a browser compatibility table [here](https://caniuse.com/#feat=gamepad). Note that Microsoft Edge captures gamepad events for browser navigation so you will not be able to use buttons like the Xbox gamepad's `B` button without causing the browser to go back a page.

# API Reference

## `GamepadHandler` object

```javascript
Gamepads
```

A `GamepadHandler` singleton is exposed as `Gamepads`. This object takes care of polling the HTML5 API for gamepads and tracking which gamepads are currently connected. Call `Gamepads.start()` to begin polling.

### Methods

```javascript
Gamepads.addEventListener(type, callback)
```

Adds an event listener to the page's gamepad handler.

Event listeners are called in order of most recently added.

#### Event types

* `event 'connect': GamepadConnectionEvent`

   Fires when a gamepad is connected or accessed for the first time (if already physically connected).

* `event 'disconnect': GamepadConnectionEvent`

   Fires when a gamepad is disconnected.

```javascript
Gamepads.removeEventListener(type, callback)
```

Removes an event listener from the page's gamepad handler.

```javascript
Gamepads.start()
```

Begins polling and updating available Gamepads at the screen frame rate.

```javascript
Gamepads.poll()
```

Polls and updates all available Gamepads. You may call this manually (via `setInterval` for example) if you need the module to update gamepads at a different rate than the screen frame rate.

```javascript
Gamepads.stop()
```

Pauses polling and updating of gamepads. May be resumed by `start()`.

### Properties

```javascript
Gamepads.gamepads
```

The map of all connected `Gamepad` objects `{ index: gamepad }`.

```javascript
Gamepads.paused
```

Read-only property indicating whether or not polling is paused.

```javascript
Gamepads.supported
```

Read-only property indicating whether or not the current browser supports the gamepads API.

## `Gamepad` object

Retrieve `Gamepad` instances via `GamepadHandler`'s `connect`/`disconnect` events or `GamepadHandler.gamepads`.

### Methods

```javascript
gamepad.addEventListener(type, callback[, index])
```

Adds an event listener to this gamepad. If `index` is supplied, the listener will apply only to events for the button at that index; otherwise (default value `-1`) the listener will apply to all buttons or axes. In the case of `'joystickmove'` events, a two-item array must be passed to `index` to handle two-axis joysticks.

Indexed event listeners are called before unindexed event listeners. After that, event listeners are called in order of most recently added.

#### Event types ####

* `type 'buttonpress': GamepadValueEvent`

   Fires when a button is pressed and passes the button `index` to the callback.

* `type 'buttonrelease': GamepadValueEvent`

   Fires when a button is released and passes the button `index` to the callback.

* `type 'buttonvaluechange': GamepadValueEvent`

   Fires when a button changes and passes the button `index` and `value` to the callback. This value will typically be `0` or `1` except in the case of an axis button like a trigger.

* `type 'axischange': GamepadValueEvent`

   Fires when a gamepad axis changes and passes the axis `index` and `value` to the callback. If a deadzone was specified for this axis via `gamepad.setAxisDeadzone`, the deadzone will be subtracted from the value to create a smoother feel.

* `type 'joystickmove': GamepadJoystickEvent`

   Fires when a joystick moves outside of the gamepad's deadzone and passes the axis indices (`horizontalIndex`, `verticalIndex`) and axis values (`horizontalValue`, `verticalValue`). Values have the deadzone subtracted from them to create a smoother feel. To use this event, users must specify in `addEventListener` the pair of axis indices corresponding to the joystick's axes.

```javascript
gamepad.removeEventListener(type, callback[, index])
```

Removes an event listener from this gamepad. If `index` is supplied, the listener will only be removed from the button at that index. In the case of `'joystickmove'` events, a two-item array must be passed to `index` to handle two-axis joysticks.

```javascript
gamepad.addJoystickEventListener(type, callback, horizontalIndex, verticalIndex)
```

Convenience method for adding joystick event listeners.

```javascript
gamepad.removeJoystickEventListener(type, callback, horizontalIndex, verticalIndex)
```

Convenience method for removing joystick event listeners.

```javascript
gamepad.update()
```

Updates this gamepad's values and fires events if necessary.

```javascript
gamepad.getButton(index)
```

Gets the button at the given `index`, in form `{ pressed: true/false, value: x }`.

```javascript
gamepad.getAxis(index)
```

Gets the floating point value of the axis at the given `index`.

```javascript
gamepad.isConnected()
```

Checks if this gamepad is connected.

```javascript
gamepad.getMapping()
```

Gets this gamepad's mapping from the internal gamepad object. This value will only be `'standard'` or `''` at time of writing.

```javascript
gamepad.setAxisDeadzone(index, deadzone)
```

Specifies a deadzone to be used for an axis on this gamepad. Joystick axis deadzones should be set with the `gamepad.joystickDeadzone` property. Must be set to range `[0, 1)`.

```javascript
gamepad.getAxisDeadzone(index)
```

Get the deadzone specified for the axis at `index`, or `undefined` if none specified.


### Properties ###

```javascript
gamepad.joystickDeadzone
```

The joystick deadzone to apply. Defaults to `0.10`. Must be set to range `[0, 1)`.

## Event Objects ##

* `_GamepadEvent` class. Underscore in name used to avoid collision with DOM's built-in [`GamepadEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GamepadEvent/GamepadEvent).
  * `gamepad`

     The gamepad for which the event occured.
  * `type`

     The event type.
  * `consume()`
     
     Consumes the event to avoid calling additional listeners.
  * `isConsumed()`

     Checks if the event is consumed.

* `GamepadConnectionEvent` class extends `_GamepadEvent`.

   Represents a gamepad connection or disconnection.

* `GamepadValueEvent` class extends `_GamepadEvent`.

   Represents a gamepad button or axis value change.

   * `index`

      The index of the button or axis.

   * `value`

      The value of the button or axis.

* `GamepadJoystickEvent` class extends `_GamepadEvent`.

   Represents a gamepad joystick change.

   * `horizontalIndex`

     The index of the horizontal axis.

   * `verticalIndex`

     The index of the vertical axis.

   * `horizontalValue`

     The value of the horizontal axis.

   * `verticalValue`

     The value of the vertical axis.

## `StandardMapping` dictionary ##

A dictionary object containing button/axis `index` values for the `standard` gamepad mapping. Use `StandardMapping.Button` for buttons and `StandardMapping.Axis` for axes.

# TODO

* Improve browser compatibility.
* Additional button image icon mapping and testing the untested mappings.
* Haptic Actuator support. Currently an experimental API internally, so a different implementation may be required per browser engine.
* Better joystick support. Maybe rewrite `GamepadJoystickEvent` to have horizontal/vertical specifiers for each axis index/value. Maybe define a Joystick object which would automatically populated by any recognized/user-defined mapping (e.g. `StandardMapping` for standard gamepads).

# Own a gamepad? #

With so many possible configurations of gamepads, browsers, and operating systems out there, I need help to verify support for various gamepad configurations. Please open issues or pull requests if you find any problems with this module or have any suggestions towards improving support.
